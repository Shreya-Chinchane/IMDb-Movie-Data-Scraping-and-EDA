# IMDb-Movie-Data-Scraping-and-EDA


This project demonstrates how to scrape IMDb movie data using Selenium and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive insights from the data. The goal is to collect movie details such as title, release year, rating, duration, number of votes, and content rating, and then analyze the data for patterns, trends, and statistics.


## ðŸš€ Project Workflow

1. **Data Scraping with Selenium**  
   - Used Selenium to automate the process of navigating IMDb and scraping movie data from the website.
   - Extracted essential details including title, release year, rating, duration, content rating, and number of votes.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned the data by removing unwanted characters, converting data types, and handling missing values.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Performed EDA to visualize and understand the relationships within the dataset.
   - Analyzed patterns in movie ratings, release years, and vote counts, and visualized the data through charts and graphs.

4. **Saved Data**  
   - Saved the cleaned and preprocessed data into a CSV file for further analysis or usage.
